## Introduction

This document outlines a detailed plan for building your all-encompassing personal AI system that will serve as a life assistant and advisor. The system will ingest, process, and reason over various aspects of your life including daily logs, fitness data, jiu-jitsu training, nutrition, career progress, finances, investments, and emotional states. The plan is structured into five progressive phases, each building upon the previous one, ensuring a scalable and robust system that meets all your specified requirements.

Absolutely ‚Äî here's a **comprehensive prompt** you can give to **Manus** (or any intelligent agent/planner like it) to generate **step-by-step instructions** for building your full personal AI system:

---

### üß† **Prompt for Manus: Design and Plan My All-Encompassing Personal AI System**

---

I want to build a fully integrated **personal AI system** that acts as a life assistant and advisor. This system should ingest and reason over everything I do: my daily logs, gym numbers, jiu-jitsu training, food intake, career progress, finances, investments, and even emotional or mental states.

I need it to go **deep, not surface-level**. I want it to make correlations (e.g., diet vs performance), recognize trends over time (e.g., jiu-jitsu frustration tied to sleep), and proactively suggest what to do next ‚Äî like when to take a break, when to invest, or when to push harder in training or work.

---

### üß© **The system must be able to:**

- Accept natural language inputs daily (via **Telegram**, voice, Notion, or form)
- Use **GPT-4** (or Claude/OpenAI) to extract structured data and store it in a database
- Track:

  - Gym logs (reps, sets, progressions)
  - Jiu-jitsu sessions (techniques trained, rolls, reflections)
  - Food and nutrition (meals, calories, macros)
  - Career/work logs (what I did, what I‚Äôm aiming for)
  - Emotions, stress, fatigue (self-reporting)
  - Financial data (Monzo expenses, Nationwide income, investment logs)

- Store structured logs in a **Postgres-based system** like **Supabase**
- Generate **embeddings** and store in a **Vector DB** (e.g., Chroma or Qdrant) for semantic memory
- Query both structured and semantic data using a reasoning agent (via **LangChain**, LlamaIndex, or custom Python agents)
- Be able to run complex chains of logic to answer questions like:

  - ‚ÄúWhen did I last feel mentally fresh while progressing in BJJ?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúAm I overspending after intense weeks of training?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúSuggest a good week for a holiday that won‚Äôt derail my fitness or goals.‚Äù

- Access external APIs:

  - **Monzo** for transactions
  - **CoinGecko** or Yahoo Finance for crypto/stock prices
  - **Skyscanner/Google Flights** to recommend travel plans

- Allow the agent to **create or modify tables** in Supabase via the Supabase API (e.g., "Create a new table to track sleep quality")
- Provide **insights, summaries, and action recommendations** (e.g., "Based on your last 3 months, a deload week is due next week.")
- Optionally offer a **dashboard or weekly report email** (optional, not needed at first)

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Tooling Required:**

| Layer                 | Tools                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Input capture         | Telegram bot, voice input, Notion form, or Google Form (connected via n8n)                       |
| Parsing / Structuring | GPT-4 via OpenAI API                                                                             |
| Automation & Flow     | **n8n**, which routes inputs, calls GPT, and saves to Supabase                                   |
| Structured DB         | **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth + API)                                                             |
| Semantic Memory       | **Vector DB** (Chroma or Qdrant)                                                                 |
| Reasoning / Agent     | **Python codebase** (using **LangChain**, OpenAI, or Claude) ‚Äî will live in **GitHub or Cursor** |
| Frontend (optional)   | Next.js + Tailwind dashboard or CLI interface                                                    |

### ‚úÖ Required Outcomes:

1. A **Python repo** I can edit in Cursor/GitHub that contains:

   - Agent logic (GPT tools, memory, API access)
   - Supabase + vector DB access
   - Query interface

2. A **Supabase schema** covering:

   - Daily logs (free text, structured mood/work data)
   - Gym
   - Jiu-jitsu
   - Food
   - Career logs
   - Financial data

3. A working **n8n flow** that:

   - Accepts input via Telegram or form
   - Sends it to GPT-4 for parsing
   - Stores the parsed output in Supabase
   - Optionally calls embedding tool and updates the vector DB

4. A way for me to:

   - Ask natural language queries (from CLI, Telegram, or small app)
   - Get detailed, reasoning-rich responses
   - Receive proactive suggestions or reports

5. Support for:

   - Autonomous database updates (LLM can create or edit tables)
   - Internet access (price lookups, travel deals, crypto prices)

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Phases (for planning purposes):

**Phase 1: Foundation**

- Build Supabase schema
- Create n8n flow for input + GPT parsing ‚Üí Supabase
- Create Python base repo

**Phase 2: Intelligence Layer**

- Add vector DB
- Build LangChain-style agent with tools
- Handle queries like: ‚ÄúHow did I train this month?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat are my current savings patterns?‚Äù

**Phase 3: External Integration**

- Connect to APIs (Monzo, CoinGecko, Skyscanner)
- Allow the agent to pull live data and reason over it

**Phase 4: Agent Autonomy**

- Let agent create new tables
- Add proactive suggestions (‚ÄúYour logs show consistent fatigue ‚Äî recommend deload‚Äù)

**Phase 5 (optional): UI / Reporting**

- Dashboard or Telegram-based summaries
- Weekly reports

---

üß† Please generate a **clear step-by-step plan** to build this from scratch, including:

- Initial setup (hosting, APIs, repo structure)
- Code scaffolding (LangChain, Supabase, vector DB setup)
- n8n workflow definition
- Security/auth for private data
- Ongoing query and task execution
