About Me
I'm a 23-year-old Web Analyst currently based in Manchester, originally from rural Herefordshire, where I grew up on my family's organic cider farm. I studied Economics at the University of York — not because I wanted to go into finance, but because I was interested in business and entrepreneurship and wanted a deeper, more analytical approach to it. I've always gravitated toward building things and understanding systems, which led me toward digital projects and data.

Professionally, I work at Kaplan, an accountancy education firm, where I focus on website analytics, A/B testing, data reporting (via SQL and Looker Studio), and stakeholder support. I've been in this role for six months, and it's taught me a lot about communication, structure, and performance analysis. I use tools like Google Tag Manager and Gemini regularly to support my work.

Outside my 9–5, I'm a technical marketer and crypto builder. I run a few websites, including Solana Guides, which gets around 300 daily visitors and features airdrop guides, memecoin trading bots, and a YouTube channel. I've also created a Meteora LP course, a crypto airdrop tracker, and manage other niche sites like a Bitcoin trading bot blog and my family's cider website, Buttford Organics — all of which I've optimized for SEO, UX, and conversions.

I'm heavily into AI and automating workflows. I've even built a bot to track my personal goals and upload daily life logs — part of a broader effort to structure my life more intentionally. I thrive in what I call "structured chaos": I love systems and planning, but I also leave room for spontaneity and experimentation.

Fitness is a core part of my routine. I lift weights, run trails, and grapple at SubZone, a wrestling-heavy Jiu-Jitsu gym. Physically, I feel good, but I often train solo and miss out on deeper social connection. I've realized recently that I spend too much time alone — working, training, or building — and I'm actively seeking to improve that.

I want more gym and tech friends, more conversations, more idea-bouncing. I'd like to attend tech or crypto conventions. I'm also looking to form my first real relationship — I've had very limited romantic experience so far, and I want that to change.

Financially, I'm in a strong position with a net worth over £100K, including ~£20K in cash and various crypto investments. Long-term, I want to build something scalable — maybe an AI-focused agency, maybe a startup. My end goal is to gain time freedom, location independence, strong relationships, and a sense of meaning in what I create.
